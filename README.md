# oh-my-zsh-playground
I heard about [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) a little while back and am only now exploring what it can do. 

For theme changes, I'm not sure if pull requests are being taken seriously right now considering I referenced an [open pull request ](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/6015)from a year ago on a different theme. 

bira_pyvirt.zsh-theme -- bira theme with support added for conda and virtualenv functions

virtualpy.plugin.zsh -- plugin to add virtualenv/conda function to other themes. Similar to the [existing virtualenv plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/virtualenv/virtualenv.plugin.zsh).
